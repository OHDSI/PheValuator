\title{PheValuator: Rapid Phenotype Evaluation}
\description{
A package for evaluating phenotype algorithms. The package develops a diagnostic prediction model using a set of noisy positives and noisy negatives. It can then apply the model to a large cohort to create a set of subjects each with a predicted probability for the health outcome of interest. This cohort can then be used to evaluate phenotype algorithms through the calculation of the necessary performance characteristics - sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative preditive value.
