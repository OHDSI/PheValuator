}
\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{ConnectionDetails created using the function
createConnectionDetails in the DatabaseConnector package.}

\item{cutPoints}{A list of threshold predictions for the evaluations.  Include "EV"
for the expected value}

\item{outFolder}{The folder where the cohort evaluation output files are written}

\item{evaluationCohortId}{A string used to generate the file names for the evaluation cohort.}

\item{phenotypeCohortId}{The ID of the cohort to evaluate in the specified cohort table.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP CDM
instance. Requires read permissions to this database. On SQL
Server, this should specifiy both the database and the
schema, so for example 'cdm_instance.dbo'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
cohort data used to define the at risk cohort is available.
Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{cohortTable}{The tablename that contains the at risk cohort. The expectation is
cohortTable has format of COHORT table: cohort_concept_id,
SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{washoutPeriod}{The mininum required continuous observation time prior to index
date for subjects within the cohort to test (Default = 0).}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the results from the phenotype
algorithm evaluation.

If 0.5 is included as a cutpoint, the data frame will have an attribute called 'misses', a dataframe
with a sample of subject ids for TPs, FPs, TNs, and FNs for the 50 percent and over prediction threshold.

Test phenotype algorithms
}
\details{
This function will perform the phenotype algorithm evaluation using the evaluation cohort returned
from createEvalCohort and the phenotype algorithm cohort specified
}
